## About Me

Hi, My name is Andrew Kim and I am a fledgling software developer.

## On The Growth Mindset
  
  The **growth mindset** is about learning to see challenges as learning opportunities. Growth can only be made with effort so it's neccessary to work through obstacles to gain experience while working towards mastering a concept.
  
### A few things to keep in mind
  
  1. Pride and ego are antithetical to maintaining a growth mindest. You have to be able to admit to yourself that you don;t know something before you can start working towards filling the gaps in your knowledge. _Be aware of your shortcomings._
  2. Comparisons are a double edged sword. While it can be useful to look to others for inspiration in your path towards mastery, it's important not to assign a value judgement ("good" or "bad") to yourself. _You're not stupid, you just haven't gotten there yet._
  3. Don't be afraid to ask for help. The people around you have different experiences form you. Sometimes all it takes to move past an obstacle is a fresh set of eyes.
