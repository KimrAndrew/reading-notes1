# Linear Regression In Python

## What Is Linear Regression

- Regression searches for relationships among variables

- Features: **Independent Variables** that influence the **Dependent Variable**

- Observation: The **Dependent Variable** being influenced by the **Independent Variables**

- Find a function that maps some features to others sufficiently well

## What Is Linear Regression Used For

- Answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related

- Forecast a response using a new set of predictors

### Simple Linear Regression

- simplest case with a single independent variable

### Multiple Linear Regression

- two or more independent variables

### Polynomial Regression

- generalized case of linear regression

## Underfitting and Overfitting

- choosing the optimal degree of the polynomial regression function

- Underfitting: when a model can't accurately capture the dependencies among data

- Overfitting: when a model learns both dependencies among data and random fluctuations.
