## TDD With Python

  - TDD is a strategy to write tests first

Important Aspects abuout Unit Tests
  - test names should be descriptive
  - test file name should follow the same name of the module

AAA: Arrange, Act, Assert

  - execute the code being tested (exercise the behavior)
  - check if results are the same as expected (output)
