## Test Coverage

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase, of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are

High coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing

Coverage numbers matter because people want to know if they are testing enough

You are doing enough testing if:
  - You rarely get bugs that make it to production
  - You are rarely hesitant to change code out of fear of production bugs

Coverage analysis helps find which bits of code aren't being tested

## Risk Analysis

Risk is the probability of any unwanted incident

Using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights potential problem areas

Potential Risks
  - use of new hardware
  - use of new technology
  - use of new automation tool
  - sequence of code
  - availability of test resources

Risk Identification

Buisiness Risks - risk that may come from your company or customer
Testing Risks - you should be well acquainted wit hthe platform you are working on
Premature Release Risk
Software Risks - risks associated with the software development process
