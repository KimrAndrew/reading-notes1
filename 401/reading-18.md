# Encrypting a message

The Ceaser Cipher is a simple subsititution cipher which replaces each original letter by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount

## Cracking The Cipher

### Frequency Analysis

"E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E"

### Known Plaintext

If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext, it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version

### Brute Force

There are only 25 possible shifts. The enemy could take the time to try each of them and find one that returned a sensible message.
