# The Data and the Distribution

Symmetrical Bell Curve

  - x-axis: values of events being measured
  - y-axis: probability associated with each event between 0 and 1

Central Limit Theorem

  - distribution of esitmates will look like a normal distribution with many estimates
  - peak of the distribution lines up with the mean
 
Three Sigma Rule

  - 68-95-99.7 Rule
  - standard deviation: average distance an observation in the data set is from the mean
  - given a normal distribution:
    - 68% of observation will fall within one standard deviation
    - 95% within two
    - 99.7% within 3
