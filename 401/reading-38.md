# React

## Conditional Rendering

- You can use JS operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state

- You can use variables to store elements

## Compostion vs Inheritance

- Some components don't know their children ahead of time
- It's recommended to pass children elements directly into their output

## Lifting State Up

- If several components need to reflect the same changing data, it's recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor
