# Graphs

Non-linear data structure of `vertices` for `nodes` connected by line segments named `edges`

## Directed vs Undirected

Undirected
- each edge is bi-directional

Directed
- every edge is directed

## Complete vs Conncected vs Disconnected

Complete Graphs
- all nodes are connected to all other nodes

Connected
- all vertices have at least one edge

Disconnected
- some vertices may not have edges

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

Cyclic
- a graph that has cycles
- nodes can be traversed through to potentially end up back at itself

Acyclic
- a directed graph without cycles
