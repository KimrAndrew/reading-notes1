  # On The Growth Mindset
  
  The growth mindset is about learning to see challenges as learning opportunities. Growth can only be made with effort so it's neccessary to work through obstacles to gain experience while working towards mastering a concept.
  
  ## A few things to keep in mind:
  
  1. Pride and ego are antithetical to maintaining a growth mindest. You have to be able to admit to yourself that you don;t know something before you can start working towards filling the gaps in your knowledge. _Be aware of your shortcomings._
  2. Comparisons are a double edged sword. While it can be useful to look to others for inspiration in your path towards mastery, it's important not to assign a value judgement ("good" or "bad") to yourself. _You're not stupid, you just haven't gotten there yet._
  3. Don't be afraid to ask for help. The people around you have different experiences form you. Sometimes all it takes to move past an obstacle is a fresh set of eyes.
