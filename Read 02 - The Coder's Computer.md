# Choosing a Text Editor

## Types of Text Editors

- Built In Text Editor
  - Bare Bones
  - Is capable of getting the job done but there are more user friendly options
- Third-Party Software
  - Comes with features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, a variety of themes, and a selection of extensions that add additional functionality
- IDE's
  - Integrated Development Environment
  - All in one software (text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger) 

Text editors and IDE's seem to be built for different purposes, it appears that choosing one is a matter of personal preferance and what functionality is needed for the project
