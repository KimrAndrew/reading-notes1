# CH 15: Layout

## Normal Flow

    - every block level element appears on a new line

## Relative Positioning

    - Shifts an element from where it would be in normal flow

## Absolute Positioning

    - Positions the element in relation to its containing element
    - Element is taken out of normal flow
    - Elements move with scroll

## Fixed Postiioning

    - Positions the element in relation to the browser window
    - Elements do not move with scroll

## Fixed Width Layouts

    -do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window
        - can end u with big gaps around the edge of a page
        - page can look much smaller on higher resolution devices
        - content boxes do not scale when user changes font size
        - design works best on devices with a resolution similar to a average desktop monitor
        -page will often take up more vertical space than a similar liquid layout

## Liquid Layouts

    - you must control the width of sections of the page to keep the design looking as intended
    - lines of text can become very long on wider devices
    - design can end up looking squashed on narrow windows
