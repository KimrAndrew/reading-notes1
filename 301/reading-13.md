## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding
What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
  - personal computers started showing up in U.S homes in significant numbers
Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - it gave them an advantage in college over people who didn't grow up using computers
Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
  
## What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  - there's a noticable difference in the amount of non-white employees in tech between 2016 and 2017
  - Congress and Fortune 500 CEO's are almost entirely male
  
## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company
  - Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
  - Diverse companies perform better
  - Companies are losing out on great talent
  - Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
  - it's the right thing to do

When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - when they are driven by commitment from company leaders

Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - diverse groups of people have more diverse ways of seeing a problem

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - Having an almost entirely right-handed team lead to 5% to 10% of videos being uploaded upside down from YouTube's iOS app because it failed to take into account how left-handed users would use the app
