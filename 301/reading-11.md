# 5 differences between SQL and NoSQL

1. Table based - Document based/ key-value / graph databases / wide-column stores

2. NoSQL Db's do not have a standard schema which they need to adhere to

3. SQL databases are vertically scalable - NoSQL is horizontally scalable

4. SQL Db's use SQL for defining and manipulating data - NoSQL syntax varies from database to database

5. NoSQL fits better for large data sets - SQL fits better for heavy-duty transactional type applications
